# To Do List
_My first academic exercise about DOM Refreshing_

**Task Indications**

Create a html page with an text input where you can add a task and by pressing a button, it passes to a list of "to do tasks".

I also must have a checkbox.

When the checkbox is checked checked, the task turns gray and crossed out.
