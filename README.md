# To Do List
_My first academic exercise about DOM Refreshing_

**Task Indications**

Create a html page with an text input where you can add a task and by pressing a button, it passes to a list of "to do tasks".

I also must have a checkbox.

When the checkbox is checked checked, the task turns gray and crossed out.

**Added by myself**
- saves tasks in localstorage to get them each time page is loaded. It's just to make it jsut a little more useful.
- delete button to eliminate tasks when they become irrelevant.
